# Flock Sense
IoT-Based Poultry Farm Management Application

## Purpose
The purpose of **Flock Sense** is to streamline poultry farm operations by providing a centralized platform for real-time monitoring, management, and reporting of poultry shed environments and performance using IoT-based automation.

## Scope
Flock Sense integrates Laravel-powered APIs with a Vue.js web frontend and Flutter mobile app to provide clients, managers, and administrators with access to crucial environmental and operational data. The platform is designed to enhance decision-making, improve animal welfare, and optimize farm productivity by automating data collection from IoT sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity) and controlling shed devices (fans, lights).

## Objectives
- Enable farm owners to monitor operations remotely.
- Provide environmental control and monitoring via IoT integration.
- Manage multiple farms and sheds efficiently.
- Generate automated reports (feed intake, mortality, environmental stats).
- Ensure a modular, scalable system for both web and mobile platforms.

# App Structure
The application is divided into two main areas:

## Admin Area
-	Used by internal administrators to manage clients, subscriptions, IoT devices, and global system settings.
-	Allows issue tracking and resolution related to system or client operations.

## Client Area
-	Accessed by clients (farm owners) and their staff (Shed Managers).
-	Facilitate farm, shed, and flock management.
-	Offers real-time IoT monitoring, manual input capabilities, and report access.
